# Repository for Frontend Developer Tests

This repository contains a collection of practical challenges designed to assess the skills of frontend developers. The challenges cover a variety of competencies, including:

- Form handling
- Data validation
- State management in React
- Component styling
- API integration

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to provide a platform where developers can showcase their skills in a controlled environment. The challenges are designed to reflect real-world situations that a developer may encounter in their daily work.

These challenges aim to evaluate not only technical skills but also problem-solving abilities and coding practices.

## Available Challenges

- **Challenge 1:** Registration Form
  - **Description:** Create a registration form that validates user input, ensuring all required fields are filled and the email format is correct. The form should provide clear feedback for errors and confirm successful submissions.
  - **Estimated Time:** ~1 hour
- **Challenge 2:** Dynamic Routing
  - **Description:** Implement a dynamic routing system in Next.js that displays product details based on user selection. Create a product listing page that lists products with links to individual product detail pages. Utilize `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` to fetch product data and generate routes dynamically. Ensure the application is responsive and provides a smooth user experience when navigating between pages.
  - **Estimated Time:** ~1 hour

## Instructions

1. **Choose a Challenge**: Review the available challenges and select one to work on.
2. **Follow the Guidelines**: Each challenge comes with specific instructions and requirements. Make sure to adhere to them closely.
3. **Code Your Solution**: Implement your solution using your preferred tools and frameworks. While React is recommended, you can also use vanilla JavaScript or any other frontend technology you are comfortable with.
4. **Test Your Code**: Ensure that your solution works as expected. You can use tools like Jest or React Testing Library for unit testing.
5. **Submit Your Implementation**: Once you are satisfied with your solution, submit your code for review.

**Tip**: It is recommended that if you are testing someone's skills, this should be done live. The challenges are designed to be completed in approximately one hour, allowing for discussion and real-time problem-solving.

## Preparing for the Challenges

To get the most out of these challenges, consider the following tips:

- **Review Relevant Technologies**: Brush up on the technologies you will be using, especially React, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Practice Common Patterns**: Familiarize yourself with common design patterns and best practices in frontend development.
- **Explore Documentation**: Make use of official documentation and online resources. Knowing how to find and utilize documentation effectively is a valuable skill.
- **Mock Interviews**: If possible, conduct mock interviews to practice your problem-solving skills under pressure.

## Contributions

The challenges are regularly updated, and contributions for new challenges are always welcome! Feel free to use and adapt the tests as needed. If you have suggestions for additional challenges or improvements, please submit a pull request or open an issue.
